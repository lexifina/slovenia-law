"""Grow a published git-for-law history append-only: new acts and newer versions go on top; nothing is rewritten.

    python -X utf8 append.py <scripts/<slug>-law> --repo <clone of the published repo> --docs-date YYYY-MM-DD

The clone's main must equal origin/main. What main already holds is read from git itself: for each act, the newest
In-force day it carries, and that the text in force on that day equals the corpus version. Then:

- an act main does not hold yet is appended as one block: its first version, then one commit per law per in-force day,
  in in-force order;
- a version of an act main already holds, in force after the newest one there, is appended as a change, as the full
  build would make it;
- a version in force on or before the newest one there that main lacks (a back-filled form), or a version whose text
  differs from main (a correction), stops the run: those need a labelled correction commit, decided by hand;
- versions in force after --docs-date are left for a later run (they are appended when their day comes).

Author date: noon local time on the in-force day, as in the full build. Committer date: the published head's committer
time plus one second per appended commit, so committer dates never go backwards and the same head and corpus always
give the same hashes. Tags that already exist are never moved; new ones are added. A documentation commit is appended
last (README, REPRODUCE.md, data/), never replacing the earlier one. The result is pushed with a plain `git push`.

Readers choose versions by the In-force trailer (tools/on.py, tools/check_repo.py), so an appended block reads the same
as a full build does.
